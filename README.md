Desktop app manage game Mimic Mania. Not a console based app. First user import the folder of the images and then rules.pdf(Just Liberation Serif text with some characters in bold and colours). So, 3 buttons at start : 1-Choose images directory; 2-Choose rules file; 3-Start game. Then. First thing, you display the rules as in the pdf until the user click the "Next" button,only button with the rules. Then, "Team A's turn" in big caracters and under , "Waiting for the player to see the image" until the user clicks "next", stil only button. Then Team A turn display is replaced by "Other team A players are guessing" and under, a big 60 seconds timer is displayed. And after the timer ends, the first image is displayed (Images will be named Image 01, Image 02,etc ) Then, a "next turn" button appears and when, we click, the image disappears. And we see "Team B's turn" in big caracters and under it, Waiting for the player to see the image until the user clicks "Next". The difference with Team A turn process is that under next turn button, there is here a "End game" button and when we click on it, the scores and the winner are displayed. As, it is a game, I would like colours and bold characters Font Liberation Serif.
